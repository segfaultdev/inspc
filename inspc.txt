SC/MP calling conventions:

- P0 stores the program counter
- P1 is used as a jumppad and a general purpose pointer
- P2 serves as a stack
- P3 holds the interrupt handler address

AC and P1 are never preserved!

P1 and E may or may not be preserved after subroutine calls,
and E is used for return values (P1 for 16-bit ones).

  ; Calling test:
  js test
done:
  jmp done

  ; Push onto the stack the sum of the first two arguments
test:
  ld @1(p2)
  ccl
  add @1(p2)
  st @-1(p2)
  ret p1
